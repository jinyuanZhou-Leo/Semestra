## Counter Plugin

### Widget

This widget is a simple counter. Functionalities are listed below:

- Could be adjusted between a minimum and maximum value. While user tries to increase the value beyond the maximum, it should not increase. Similarly, while user tries to decrease the value below the minimum, it should not decrease. There should be a jitter animation when user tries to increase/decrease the value beyond the maximum/minimum.
- Could be increased or decreased by the step value.
- There should be an initial value.
- There should be a small, round reset button to reset the counter to the initial value.
- There should be a text box below the counter to display user customizable text. Default value is empty.
